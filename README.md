## Description

This project is part of the Udacity Professional Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program.
It consists of a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.


## Features

- The section actively being viewed is differentiated from other sections.
- when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls the user to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump.
- The responsive layout of the landing page is usable across all devices.
- All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
